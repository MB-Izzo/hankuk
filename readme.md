# Korean to French dictionary

Translate Korean to French using Google's Gemini AI.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py <korean_word>
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google GenAI library

## Notes

This is mostly a personal script. In korean, causative/passive form is often a difficult point for me so this small script helps with that.

Sometimes, it invents passive forms though: if I input 아우르다, it often says 아울리다 is the passive form but this form does not exist.
